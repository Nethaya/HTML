    The above game is the first one i ever created on my own, with the help of code.org. Since I created in 
    December, the cozy and cold Christmas vibes inspired me to created something 'snowy themed'. Hence, I named my 
    first ever game 'Ice Climber'. Click the above image to visit the site i create it in and play my game.
