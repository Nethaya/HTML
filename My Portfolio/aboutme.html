<h2>
  My name is Nethaya Bastian. I'm a fourteen year old. I'm a passionate, self-driven, independent and 
  enthustiastic young girl who loves to explore new opportunities. Coding was a whole new challenge for me at first.
  But i found it very interesting and engaging as I learned. Till now, I've created 4 individual games on my own, along
  with numerous projects, with the assistance of my teacher. Coding has opened my eyes to see a new sight of the 
  technological world at present. I'm currently learning JavaScript and HTML as coding languages and I hope to 
  continue to enhance my knowledge of coding by learning many more languages in the years to come. Thanks a lot 
  for visiting my 'about me' page. If you'd like to know and see what kinds of projects I've been creating 
  visit the 'Projects' page to check them out. And remember that 'anyone can learn anything as long as you have
  the determination to do so'. To know more about me, follow me on my Social Media. I'll leave them down below.
  Also, this Portfolio is also a proud coding creation by me. :) Lots of Love.
